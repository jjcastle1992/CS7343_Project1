README FOR JAMES CASTLE CS7343 PROGRAMMING 1 ASSIGNMENT

For Fibonacci Numbers (Question 1), simply input an integer number
that is greater than zero to receive the Fibonacci sequence for
that quantity of integers. (i.e. inputting "3" will get you the 
sequence: 0, 1, 1).

For Question 2 (Scheduling Algorithms), you'll be presented with
a simple command line interface giving you 5 Scheduling options to
run on a default set of "Processes" found in "schedule.txt"

    NOTE: You may need to adjust the absolute file path for filename if 
    the relative file path for schedule.txt does not work.

You can continue to choose additional scheduling alogorthms to run by
entering 'y' during the continue to run prompt. If you enter 'n' or anything
else, the program will terminate.
